    <h1> Rafael Queiroz </h1>
    <p><em> Operations Manager at IGT Solutions and Software Engineering Student </em></p>

    <p align="justify">
        Passionate about continuous processes improvement and technology. Naturally curious, I’ve discovered a recent
        interest for coding, so I decided to go back to university. I am a second year Software Engineering student.
        Complimentary I also study Python programing language, web development, iOS development and AWS cloud.
        I am originally from Brazil and based in Dubai since 2011. I can speak Portuguese and English fluently,
        conversational Spanish and risk a few words in French.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        As a goal-focused and success-driven professional, I have a progressive experience in operations and key
        account management; backed by adeptness in optimizing operational performance and driving revenue growth.
        I am known for expertise in hiring qualified talents and building top-caliber workforce, thus preventing
        staffing gap. This involved creating and implementing training programs and materials focused on upskilling
        employees and aligning their performance with organizational requirements. In addition, I am keen at addressing
        areas for improvement and arising problems by creating viable solutions and executing strategic plans.
        Throughout my career, I have exemplified effectiveness in forging beneficial relationships and collaborating
        with multicultural professionals by leveraging solid interpersonal and multilingual abilities. Through this,
        I was able to convey organizational mission and objectives to target audience. It also helped in guaranteeing
        the delivery of best-in-class customer service and accomplishment of organizational goals.
